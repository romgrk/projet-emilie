colorMode() changes the way p5.js interprets color data. By default, the parameters 
for fill(), stroke(), background(), and color() are defined 
by values between 0 and 255 using the RGB color model. This is equivalent 
to setting colorMode(RGB, 255). Setting colorMode(HSB) lets you use the HSB 
system instead. By default, this is colorMode(HSB, 360, 100, 100, 1). You can also use HSL.

Note: existing color objects remember the mode that they were created in, 
so you can change modes as you like without affecting their appearance.
