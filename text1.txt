rectMode(CENTER) interprets the first two parameters as the shape's center point, 
while the third and fourth parameters are its width and height.

rectMode(RADIUS) also uses the first two parameters as the shape's center point,
 but uses the third and fourth parameters to specify half of the shape's width 
and height respectively.

The parameter to this method must be written in ALL CAPS because they are
 predefined as constants in ALL CAPS and Javascript is a case-sensitive language.
