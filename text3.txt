A class to describe a two or three dimensional vector, 
specifically a Euclidean (also known as geometric) vector.
 A vector is an entity that has both magnitude and direction. 
The datatype, however, stores the components of the vector
 (x, y for 2D, and x, y, z for 3D). The magnitude and direction can 
be accessed via the methods mag() and heading().

In many of the p5.js examples, you will see p5.Vector used
 to describe a position, velocity, or acceleration. 
For example, if you consider a rectangle moving across the screen, 
at any given instant it has a position (a vector that points from the origin to its location),
 a velocity (the rate at which the object's position changes per time unit, expressed as a vector),
 and acceleration (the rate at which the object's velocity changes per time unit, expressed as a vector).
